HexaBot

My code for my CS231n project at Stanford for a convolutional neural network (CNN) that can play the game Super Hexagon.
This includes a Processing sketch that generates imitation screenshots of Super Hexagon, the Python code that trains the CNN using Theano/Lasagne, and the Python code that plays Super Hexagon using the trained CNN.

The project is described in detail in this report and demonstrated in these videos playing levels 1 and 2.
